* Introduction
=Keepass.el= is a simple interface between =kpcli= (http://kpcli.sourceforge.net/) and Emacs.
It uses =popup-el= https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el to display the entries.
I just did it for convenience to keep my work-flow inside Emacs and avoid switching between windows to get my passwords copied to the clipboard. 
A lot of improvements could be done, in particular for security purposes.

* Installation
** Requirements
Please make sure that the following are installed 
- =popup.el= https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el
- =kpcli= http://kpcli.sourceforge.net/

** Installation
Now you can add =keepass.el= to the directory of your choice and in your =.emacs=: 
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/keepass-el/")
(require 'keepass)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'keepass-launch) ;; Set the key to launch it
#+END_SRC

** Usage
You can now run =M-x keepass-launch= command or directly hit =C-c p= if you put the previous keyboard shortcut to your =.emacs= file.
A popup will appear so that you can get your password onto your clipboard. 

_Note:_ The clipboard is not (yet) automatically cleared!

* Troubleshooting
** Missing modules in =kpcli=
Depending on your method to install =kpcli= you may have to install additional =PERL= modules on CPAN. Check the error returned by =kpcli=. I personally had to install Clipboard and Capture-Tiny modules.
Either use the =cpanm= command line or compile the modules manually as explained in the CPAN website.

** Copy doesn't work in =kpcli=
Based on this thread: https://sourceforge.net/p/kpcli/bugs/38/

If the copy in =kpcli= returns no error but nothing is copied onto the clipboard, then check that =xclip= is installed on your machine.
Then try the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "test copy" | xclip -in
#+END_SRC

If it works, you are ready to go. Otherwise, try this one: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "test copy" | xclip -in -selection clipboard
#+END_SRC

If this second one works but not the first one, then perform the following steps: 
1. Download manually the package Clipboard on CPAN (https://metacpan.org/release/KING/Clipboard-0.13). 
2. Extract the archive
3. Go to the Clipboard folder you just extracted 
4. Open the file =Xclip.pm= under the folder =./lib/Clipboard/=
5. Modify the line =sub all_selections { qw(primary buffer clipboard secondary) }= to =sub all_selections { qw(clipboard primary buffer secondary) }=
6. Go back to the Clipboard folder 
7. Compile and install by running =perl Makefile.PL && make all test && sudo make install=

Now the copy in =kpcli= should work.
